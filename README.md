Working with Block in Launch School's RB130 Course

This repository contains code from the Blocks Section of Launch School's RB130 course. This contains the custom 
method assignments as well as the todo-list assignment.
The custom methods are meant to emulate the functionality from the Array class: each, select, reduce.
